# salesforce_Ideas_validation
Validation for improper use of offensive or inappropriate language for 'Ideas' in the community. 

This repository is intended to help save people time when setting up their Ideas pages. Please be advised that this document will contain a lot of swearing and potentially offensive language.

Currently, these validation pages do not contain any methods to work around the "Scunthorpe problem" (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem) but this should be added in the future either by myself or someone else. 

Steps on adding these validation rules to the community can be found here: https://eu3.salesforce.com/help/pdfs/en/salesforce_ideas_implementation_guide.pdf
